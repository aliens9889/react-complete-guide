# Redux Counter

This is a project to understand the principles and bases about redux with react (Now the difference with the other counter, this one will have thunk and make the code more organize). You can run the project like the others ones on this repo. 

The project will have a header that show you how much the counter has stored, the counter will work with four buttons (INCREMENT(+1), DECREMENT(-1), ADD(+10), SUBTRACT(-15)).

As I mentioned you can run the project as always but first remember to install depencies you can do it with this command

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn install
```

If your package.json doesn't show the redux dependy you can install it this way

```
npm install redux
```

or like this

```
yarn add redux
```
